## Development
One of the most well-known IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) for .NET development is [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=15#) (Free version linked); however, if you're feeling dangerous you can also use an [alternative](http://web.archive.org/web/20071217202115/http://www.dotnetcoders.com/web/Articles/ShowArticle.aspx?article=49)

There are 2 .NET versions that are used for different tasks; .NET Core and .NET Frmework

> .NET Core - Used for cross-platform (Linux, Mac, & Windows) development

> .NET Framework - Used for only Windows development

If using Visual Studio, the installer will prompt for various additions to be added to the installation package. If a specific .NET version (whether it be Core or Framework) is not found in your installation, you can download it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
