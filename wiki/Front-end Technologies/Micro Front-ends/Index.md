## Overview
Micro font-ends is a concept that allows for developers to split up the front-end of a web application into separate components. These pieces are technology agnostic and are maintained separately, most of the time by different teams. This creates a separation of concerns between components as each team can focus only on the specific component. Each component is usually wrapped in a Web Component and deployed individually. Once deployed, it can be consumed by a parent component/page, where the parent would tie multiple components together.

The below diagram illustrates the micro front-end concept:
